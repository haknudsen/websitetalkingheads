Our Kickstarter videos will help you convince generous donors to fund your project. We know you’re passionate about your idea, so we work with you. Sure, a written letter can accomplish the same thing, but a video makes it more personal—the effort counts here, too. You’ll be able to really show them what your project is about; the more they understand, the likelier people would donate. With our custom made presentation packages, you can transform your website and social media accounts from text-filled pages to a high-definition virtual presentation, all at a competitive price.</p>			<p>Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects.
