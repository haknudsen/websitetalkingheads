        <h2>Player Features</h2>
        <dt>Responsive</dt>
        <dd>With the rise of responsive websites we have added the ability to place our player inside a specific div tag.  If you set the responsive variable to "yes" you can then place 
            &lt;div id=&quot;wthvideo&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; inside of the div you would like the video to play in. This will place the video inside of that tag, where ever it is on the page. </dd>
        <dt>How it Plays</dt>
        <dd> You can choose from several autostart features including; Auto Play, Click-to-Play, Click-for-Audio, Play Once then Click-to-Play, Loop and more. </dd>
        <dt>When it Plays</dt>
        <dd> You can add a delay before your video starts or playing your video can be triggered by an event on screen. </dd>

        <dt>Responsive</dt>
        <dd>With the rise of responsive websites we have added the ability to place our player inside a specific div tag. If you set the responsive variable to "yes" you can then place the player's div tag inside of the div you would like the video to play in. This will place the video inside of that tag, wherever it is on the page.</dd>
