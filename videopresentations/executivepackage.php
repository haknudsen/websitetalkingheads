<h2>Video Presentation- Executive Package</h2>
<p>With the Executive Package you get a video spokesperson and your script can be up to 360 words. You also get the static or motion background of your choice from our library or we can design a custom background for you. You can have your logo, phone number and/or website displayed during the video. You can also have an intro and outro that includes your website, logo, company name, and an effect.</p>
<p>You can choose music from our library or provide your own, royalty-free music. You can have up to 18 visual elements. That includes up to 10 text sequences, up to 10 images, and 5 video elements. These elements can either come from our library or be provided by you. If you provide these elements they must be royalty-free and you must own the commercial rights.  You can purchase the use of additional elements at a cost of 2 for $100.</p>
<p>In order to keep the cost of our videos low we allow a limited number of revisions. With the Executive Package this is 1 revision. </p>
