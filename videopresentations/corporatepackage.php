<h2>Video Presentation- Corporate Package</h2>
<p>With the Corporate Package you get a video spokesperson and your script can be up to 820 words. You also get the static or motion background of your choice from our library or we can design a custom background for you. You can have your logo, phone number and/or website displayed during the video. You can also have an intro and outro that includes your website, logo, company name, and an effect.</p>
<p>You can choose music from our library or provide your own, royalty-free music. You can have up to 60 visual elements. That includes up to 40 text sequences, up to 40 images, and 10 video elements. These elements can either come from our library or be provided by you. If you provide these elements they must be royalty-free and you must own the commercial rights.  You can purchase the use of additional elements at a cost of 2 for $150.</p>
<p>In order to keep the cost of our videos low we allow a limited number of revisions. With the Corporate Package this is 2 revisions. </p>
