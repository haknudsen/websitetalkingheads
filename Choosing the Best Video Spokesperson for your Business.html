These are the people who greet you and introduce a business’ services or products whenever you visit their website. A video spokesperson, also known as a virtual actor, is basically an online video of actors overlaid alongside a site’s content. Instead of reading plain text, which can get boring for some, these actors basically walk you through everything you need to know and keep your attention for much longer when compared to simple articles.</p><p>Think of them as no different from the presenters you see on TV. Whether they’re relaying information, news updates, messages or trying to sell you a new product, their job is to hold your attention and convince you to give what they’re offering a try. Not an easy feat considering the short attention span that most people have! This is one of the reasons why choosing the right actor or actress for the job is important.</p><p>Here are three key things to keep in mind when choosing the right web spokesperson for your business:</p><h3>ENERGY</h3><p>Even without saying a word, a person’s energy can speak volumes. If someone is feeling off or uncomfortable, the way they speak and move would convey this. The same can be said, of course, for a website spokesperson. As such, always look for someone who has great energy that also transfers well into video; truth be told, some people can get TOO energetic and this may come off as overacting to the viewer. </p><p>Remember, enthusiasm cannot be faked. You can write a great script for your actor, but if they can’t provide the right amount of energy for the job, even that would fall flat.</p> <h3>VOICE CLARITY</h3><p>As they are speaking “directly” to your clients, your chosen spokes-model should be able to deliver the message clearly. Now, it is important to note that clarity does not equal volume. It’s in how the words are pronounced and intonated; if you have to listen two or three times to what the person is saying, then it’s high time that you look for another actor for the job. </p><p>That said, always allow your spokesperson a bit of time to practice before you begin shooting. Allow them to warm-up to the script you have written and make notes on what must be emphasized. </p><h3>AESTHETICS</h3><p>This is completely dependent on the type of image you want to be associated with your business. For example, if you’re recording your spokespeople for a business that deals with surfboards, you would want an actor who matches that image. They need to be relatable to your target market. Can you imagine a man dressed in a sleek suit trying to sell surfboards? </p><p>Diversity is another key component if you’re aiming for relatability. Here’s a fact: if a person can see themselves your chosen representative, they are likelier to trust your business more and be more willing to purchase what you’re offering.</p><p>Keep these things in mind when you’re looking for the right actor or actress to get for your website. Choose well as they will be the face of your business for anyone who visits your page. </p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just updated our Spokespeople Page.
