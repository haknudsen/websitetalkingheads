        <h1>Choosing the Best Video Spokesperson for your Business</h1>
        <h2>Finding the Virtual Actor that is right for you.</h2>

            <p class="summary">You've witnessed them before. These are the men and women that greet you and introduce a business' products whenever you visit their own website. A video spokesperson, often called a virtual actor, is actually an online video with actors overlaid alongside some sort of site's content. Instead with reading plain text, that can get boring for a few, these actors basically go around you through everything you have to know and keep your particular attention for much longer than the simple articles.</p>
            <p class="summary">Think of them like the presenters so you see on TV. When they're relaying info, news updates, messages or selling you a innovative product, their job may be to hold your particular attention and convince want you to give what they're offering a go. Not an easy feat along with the short attention span that a lot of people have! This is among the most reasons why selecting the most appropriate actor or actress for any job is fundamental.</p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p>Even without saying a word, a person's energy can speak volumes. If someone is feeling off or uncomfortable, the way they speak and move would convey this. The same can be said, of course, for a website spokesperson. As such, always look for someone who has great energy that also transfers well into video; truth be told, some people can get TOO energetic and this may come off as overacting to the viewer. </p>
                        <p>Remember, enthusiasm cannot be faked. You can write a great script for your actor, but if they can't provide the right amount of energy for the job, even that would fall flat. </p>

                    <div class="panel-body">
                        <p>As they are speaking "directly" to your clients, your chosen spokes-model should be able to deliver the message clearly. Now, it is important to note that clarity does not equal volume. It's in how the words are pronounced and intonated; if you have to listen two or three times to what the person is saying, then it's high time that you look for another actor for the job. </p>
                        <p>That said, always allow your spokesperson a bit of time to practice before you begin shooting. Allow them to warm-up to the script you have written and make notes on what must be emphasized. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="panel-body">
                <p>This is completely dependent on the type of image you want to be associated with your business. For example, if you're recording your spokespeople for a business that deals with surfboards, you would want an actor who matches that image. They need to be relatable to your target market. Can you imagine a man dressed in a sleek suit trying to sell surfboards? </p>
                <p>Diversity is another key component if you're aiming for relatability. Here's a fact: if a person can see themselves your chosen representative, they are likelier to trust your business more and be more willing to purchase what you're offering.</p>
